# Affine

We will mine reasoning for the world.

## Introduction

Affine is a an incentivized RL environment which pays miners which make incremental improvements on a set of tasks (for instance, program abduction or coding). The mechanism is sybil-proof (you can't cheat by deploying multiple miners), decoy-proof (you can't cheat by packing models into certain environments), copy-proof (you can't cheat by stealing models), overfitting-proof (you can't cheat by overfitting to a single env). 

How does Affine work? Affine validators incentivize miners to submit models to Subnet 64 on Bittensor (a.k.a Chutes) where they are inference load balanced and publicly available. These models are evaluated on a set of RL-environments with validators looking for the model which dominates the pareto frontier -- namely the model which out competes all other models on all envs (see `af validator`) The network is winners-take-all where miners are forced to copy, download and improve the pareto frontier model.

Why affine? Directed incentives for RL have never been achieved. The ability to direct intelligence and aggregate the work-effort of a large non-permissioned group of individuals on RL tasks will unlock fast advancement in intelligence, we intend to commoditize reasoning (intelligence's highest form) and break the intelligence sound barrier.

## Installation
```bash
# Install uv Astral
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Clone and install Affine
git clone https://github.com/AffineFoundation/affine.git
cd affine
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate && uv pip install -e .

# Verify installation
af
```

## Validating

Set env vars, chutes api key.
```bash
# Copy .env and fill out items.
cp .env.validator.example .env
```

(Recommended): Run the validator with docker and watchtower autoupdate.
```bash
# Run the validator with watchtower.
docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d && docker-compose logs -f
```

Run the validator locally
```bash
# Start the validator with debug.
af -vv validate
```

# Mining

1. Miners need a chutes developer account ( `chutes.ai` )
```bash
chutes register
```

2. Set env vars.
```bash
# Copy .env and fill out items.
cp .env.validator.example .env
```

3. Register your miner to Affine (S120).
```bash
btcli subnet register --wallet.name <your cold> --wallet.hotkey <your hot>
```

4. Pull a model off the network.
```bash
af -vvv pull <uid to pull> --model_path <i.e. ./my_model>
```

5. Improve the model
```bash
... magic RL stuff ...
```

6. Push the model to your miner.
```bash
af -vvv push  --coldkey <your cold> --hotkey <your hot> --model_path <i.e. ./my_model>
```


# SDK
Affine is also an SDK you can use to generate and evaluate models envs.
```python
import affine as af

# Get all miner model endpoints
miners = await af.miners()

# Get a miner endpoint for a UID
miner = await af.miners( 5 )

# Generate a SAT challenge
chal = await af.SAT.generate() 

# Generate a bunch.
chals = await af.ABDUCTION().many( 10 )
chals = await af.DEDUCTION().many( 10 )

# Query the model directly.
response = await af.query( chal.prompt, model = miner.model )

# Evaluate the response
evaluation = chal.evaluate( response ) 
print( evaluation.score )

# Query the miner and do the eval all in one go.
results = await af.run( chals, miners )

# Pull data from trials 1000 blocks in the past.
validator_results = af.dataset( tail = 1000 )
```
